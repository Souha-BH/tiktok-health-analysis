## Annotation Guidelines for TikTok Health-Related Behaviors
1. **Overview of the Annotatorâ€™s Job**
As an annotator, your task is to watch no more than 30 seconds of each TikTok video, accessible via the webVideoUrl column, and determine whether the video depicts or mentions a risky health behavior. If a risky health behavior is observed, you will categorize it based on the type of behavior. You should place a check mark in the appropriate column: either for "Unrisky Behavior" or one of the risk categories: Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Unhealthy Diet, or Other Risky Behavior.

2. **Set of Labels and Their Descriptions**
- **Unrisky Behavior**: The video does not show or mention any risky health behavior or the video discourage an unhealthy behavior/ encourage a healthy behavior. This could include either positive or neutral behaviors.
- **Risky Behavior (Smoking)**: The video shows or mentions smoking (e.g., smoking cigarettes, vaping).
- **Risky Behavior (Alcohol Consumption)**: The video shows or mentions alcohol consumption (e.g., drinking beer, wine, or any alcoholic beverages).
- **Risky Behavior (Unhealthy Diet)**: The video shows or mentions unhealthy eating habits (e.g., Overconsumption of Junk/Processed Foods, Excessive Intake of Sugary Beverages, Crash Diets or Extreme Caloric Restriction, Overeating or Encouraging Binge Eating, Neglecting Essential Nutrients, Promoting Harmful Dietary Supplements). 
- **Risky Behavior (Other)**: The video shows or mentions any other type of risky health behavior (e.g., reckless behavior, drug use, or similar health risks).
  
3. **Annotation Rules and Criteria**
- If the person in the video explicitly discourages an unhealthy behavior, annotate the video as Unrisky Behavior, even if the behavior is mentioned.
- If the person is performing an unhealthy behavior (e.g., lighting a cigarette, drinking alcohol) without discouraging it, label the video with the corresponding risky behavior.
- If you observe the person engaging in multiple risky behaviors in the same video (e.g., smoking while drinking alcohol), select all applicable risky behaviors.
- If the video contains no clear mention or depiction of risky behaviors but instead focuses on neutral or positive behaviors, label it as Unrisky Behavior.
- If the video is not in a language you can understand, please skip it while annotating.
- **Edge cases**: If you're unsure, use the "Other" category for any behaviors not explicitly covered by the other labels. You can also flag the video for review if necessary.
